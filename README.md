## PROJECTS

### MNIST Classifier, Dec 2022 - [Notebook](https://github.com/destefy/MNISTclassifier/blob/main/MNISTclassifier/classifier_github.ipynb).

To get a better understanding of some basic machine learning techniques, I created a model to classifier the classic MNIST hand-written number data set. The key concepts used were:
 - Softmax Regression, to allow the model to use a regression technique
 - Minibatch Stocastic Gradient Descent, the chosen regression technique
 
 After 10 training epochs, I achieved an accuracy of 94%.

### Messaging App, ECE361 Nov - Dec 2022
As part of my 3rd Computer Networks class, I created a messaging app. Using persistent TCP connections, my teammate and I created a client and server program. Features included:
 - Allowing users to register a login username and password in a database
 - Allowing user to login/connect to the server with username-password checking
 - Allowing users to create and join sessions
 - Allowing users to broadcast messages to users in their session
 - Allowing users to send private messages to one another
 - Printing a list of all current users and sessions.

### Radio Transceiver, ECE295. Jan - Apr 2022 
As part of my 2nd year Hardware Design class, I worked on a Team of 3 students to design, build and test two radio transceiver (transmitter + receiver) components. Specific contributions included,

- Used Altium and Multisim to design the limiter, filter, mixer, and amplifier radio receiver circuits.
- Demonstrated successful integration of our subcircuits into a functioning radio receiver.
- Communicated the teamâ€™s design and testing decisions to both a technical and non-technical audience through multiple presentations and progress reports.

### Dr. Mario, ECE243. Jan - Apr 2022 - [Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/Sxyitkk7tpI)
As part of my 2nd year Computer Organization class, I recreated the popular NES game, Dr. Mario, on a DE1-SoC board using C and the CPUlator simulator. Dr. Mario is a tetris-like game where you move falling pills to eliminate viruses.

- Designed algorithms to control the pill behaviour, detect collisions and four of the same colour in a row.
- Detected interrupts from a keyboard and timers.

### Lossy Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition, MAT188. Sep - Dec 2020 
As part of my first year linear algebra class (MAT188), I explored how singular value decomposition (a matrix factorization technique) could be used for image compression.
