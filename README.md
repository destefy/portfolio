## PROJECTS
### Radio Transceiver, ECE295. Jan - Apr 2022 
As part of my 2nd year Hardware Design class (ECE295), I worked on a Team of 3 students to design, build and test two radio transceiver (transmitter + receiver) components. Specific contributions included,

- Used Altium and Multisim to design the limiter, filter, mixer, and amplifier radio receiver circuits.
- Demonstrated successful integration of our subcircuits into a functioning radio receiver.
- Communicated the teamâ€™s design and testing decisions to both a technical and non-technical audience through multiple presentations and progress reports.

### Dr. Mario, ECE243. Jan - Apr 2022. - https://github.com/destefy/Dr.-Mahdi
As part of my 2nd year Computer Organization class (ECE243), I recreated the popular NES game, Dr. Mario, on a DE1-SoC board using C and the CPUlator simulator. Dr. Mario is a tetris-like game where you move falling pills to eliminate viruses.

- Designed algorithms to control the behaviour of pills, detect collisions between pills and viruses, and detect four of the same colour in a row.
- Detected interrupts from a keyboard and timers.

### Lossy Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition, MAT188. Sep - Dec 2020 - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0BLIv7QCa_5vH29sBMTlUehxuQzOXBKs0ePxEL4RJs/edit?usp=sharing)
As part of my first year linear algebra class (MAT188), I explored how the singular value decomposition (a matrix factorization technique) could be used for image compression.
